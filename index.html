			<h1>Hello, Welcome to my page !</h1>

				Hello, my name is Vincent Titeca-Beauport and I'm in Master 1 Audit and Control at IESEG Paris. 
			I am creating this profil page as part of my course "Introduction to Web Development" with Le Wagon.
			I will talk a little about myself and my passions in the next lines. &#128522;.

			<h2> My hobbies&#9973;&#128023;&#127803</h2>
			<p>
			Since college I have accompanied my grandfather on hunting trips and since I am 16 years old and got my license I am hunting as well.
			I practiced judo until the end of high school and when I got my brown belt; before that I was practicing Hobie cat (watersport). 
			Since 2013 I’m doing ball-trap and since 2016 I’m practicing shooting sport in Paris.
			I love agriculture and boat trips, because my garden and the ocean are two very quiet places. 
			</p>

			<h2>My professional project &#128188;</h2>
			<p>I come from Guadeloupe, that's why my career objective is to be able to go back there in 7 years to manage jewellery stores, indeed watchmaking and jewellery are two fields that interest me enormously and this since I was a child. In order to achieve my goal, since my arrival in France in 2016, I'm going to the biggest trade fairs as a professional buyer in Basel, Geneva, Vicenza and even in Bangkok and Hong Kong. This allows me to meet future collaborators and to get an idea of the way of working in this field. </p>
